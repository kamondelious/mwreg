        /* team members are very likely to know the leader in real life already */
    + send email to team admins if not already requested by this user
    + add interface for leader to accept memberships
      + send email to accepted member when accepted
    - add interface to un-accept members, and also to make/unmake them admin

- improvements
  - allow teams, mechs, and events to upload images and/or take URLs straight to flickr
  - re-structure to use a single top-level loader script, and put utilities, views, and 
    application logic into three separate directories.
  - intra-team email/discussions
  - event payment integration (stripe, paypal)
  - keep track of teams/mechs/scores after events
  - admin listing of all users

- deployment
  - host this somewhere real
  - set up proper SSH access for trusted machine admins
  - figure out what domain name to use
  - make sure backups are taken on a regular basis
